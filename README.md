## Overview

**CVE-2024-38063** is a critical security vulnerability in the Windows TCP/IP stack that allows for remote code execution (RCE). The vulnerability is due to improper handling of IPv6 network packets by Windows, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

- **CVE ID**: CVE-2024-38063
- **CVSS Score**: 9.8 (Critical)
- **Impact**: Remote Code Execution
- **Affected Components**: Windows TCP/IP stack
- **Exploitation Vector**: Network (Remote)

## Vulnerability Details

An attacker can exploit CVE-2024-38063 by sending specially crafted IPv6 packets to a target machine. Due to the improper handling of these packets, the attacker can trigger a buffer overflow, leading to the execution of malicious code with escalated privileges. This can result in unauthorized access, data breaches, or complete system compromise.

## Affected Versions
